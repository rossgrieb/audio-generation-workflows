# Example Script (After - Optimized for Natural Delivery)

> Notes:
> - Short phrases = better cadence and fewer run-on artifacts
> - Line breaks guide pacing more than heavy emphasis
> - Punctuation acts as performance direction

Hey, thanks for trying this.

In the next minute,
I’ll show you a simple workflow
to get a clean, natural result.

First,
upload a clean audio sample.

Then,
choose the voice you want.

Next,
paste your script —
but keep it in short, speakable phrases.

Generate a quick pass.
Listen for pacing and emphasis.

If anything feels off,
adjust one thing at a time
and iterate in short renders.

Most of the quality comes from two things:
clean inputs,
and disciplined iteration.

Alright —
let’s get into it.
