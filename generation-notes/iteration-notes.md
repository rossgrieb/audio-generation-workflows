# Iteration Notes (Example)

## Goal
Produce a short voiceover that sounds natural, consistent, and production-ready.

## Baseline
- Script: unstructured paragraph
- Audio: raw input with minor sibilance
- Target tone: conversational and neutral

## Pass 1 — Baseline Render
Observed rushed pacing and inconsistent emphasis.

## Change 1 — Script Segmentation
Split script into short phrases and added minimal punctuation.

**Result:** improved cadence and fewer emphasis artifacts.

## Change 2 — Input Cleanup
Reduced sibilance and normalized timing.

**Result:** clearer consonants and more consistent tone.

## Takeaway
Most gains came from input discipline rather than parameter tuning.
